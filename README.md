# Cohort-Analysis
1.Cohort helps you to identify the behaviour of customer , Example lets take a real example of facebook where the company want to understand how many hours a user is spending or logging in to the website from the day he signed up to current day, here cohort analysis help you to identify the individual behaviour and a similar group of people who signed up on the same day or same month or same quarter how one behaviour is different from one another
2. So when we are able to identify this kind of behaviour analysis then we can go into the depth drive of data and realy understand what kind of think sepreates a group of users  from one another.
